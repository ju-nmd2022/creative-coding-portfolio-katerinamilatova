    "description": "This work is a recreation of QQL (2022) by Tyler Hobbs. It is my first generative art. I started with creating one circle, then adding it into a grid, and at the end, adjusting colors and randomness. I decided to change the colors to give the artwork a bit different feel than the original artwork."
